# hello-world
Just another repository 

My name is Lauren Pavitt. I want to become amazing at this shit. 
I absolutely love any challenge and will complete it. I'm going to finish the 2 080 hours in no time.
2 080 hours is almost 6 years if you spend and hour on it everyday but is 87 days if you spend every second of your life here. 
Well, this is more than I anticipated but I'm going to give it a go anyway. Wait, that guy said he got a job after 800 hours and that is only a month. A month... Oh well, I have a month and a half till I start university. I can do it!
See you suckers!
